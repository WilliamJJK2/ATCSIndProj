# ATCSIndProj
This is my final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course at Polytechnic School

Day 2: I am deciding between a couple of ideas that I want to do. I wanted to try to figure out how to create a card game such as blackjack or poker, or I could create a system that stores and measures data depending on certain circumstances. After deliberating between these two choices, I believe that the second idea was too basic in the idea, so I am deciding to create a blackjack game.

Day 3: Today, I focused on developing a card and deck class for my independent project. I started by creating the Card class, which includes attributes for the card's rank and suit, along with methods to retrieve those values. Afterwards, I designed the Deck class, which creates a standard deck of 52 cards and puts the correct value on each card such as the named cards so that they conform with the rules of Blackjack. I also added a shuffling version in order to not have the cards in a chronological order. I have successfully implemented and tested these classes during class.
