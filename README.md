# ATCSIndProj
This is my final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course at Polytechnic School

Day 2: I am deciding between a couple of ideas that I want to do. I wanted to try to figure out how to create a card game such as blackjack or poker, or I could create a system that stores and measures data depending on certain circumstances. After deliberating between these two choices, I believe that the second idea was too basic in the idea, so I am deciding to create a blackjack game.
